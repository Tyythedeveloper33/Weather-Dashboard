# Weather Dashboard

## Almost fully functional weather board to  display current & future forecast
This project was built with VS CODE with the intent on building a fully functional weather dashboard where the user would be able to search a city & pull up the current day's weather along with the 5 day forecast after the current day, also I have made it so the users cities searched get saved into local storage & it creates a button, unfortanatley I got stuck on this part & will need to refactor this code so that on the click of the buttons it appends the same information appended when you search a city by name.

* WHEN user searches for a city THEN user is presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN user views current weather conditions for that city,  THEN user is presented with the city name, the date, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* WHEN user views future weather conditions for that city , THEN user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

 * step 2- you want to create a repository to your local environment(Terminal) using command- git init
 * step 3- you will want to open up this code from your terminal onto Visual Studio Code using command- code .
 * Step 4- once VS-Code is open you will click open folder, and find the folder you named in (step #1)
 * Step 5- you will notice that the folder is empty, go ahead and create 3 new files  and rename them(index.html, script.js, and style.css) by right clicking over the untitled file, then click rename!
 * Step 6- Go ahead back to where you found my gitgub pages, and copy the index.html, and paste it into yours!
 * Step 7- Go ahead back to where you found my gitgub pages, and copy the style.css, and paste it into yours!
 * Step 8- Go ahead back to where you found my gitgub pages, and copy the script.js, and paste it into yours!

 * Step 9- From here on out this is where you can edit the code to better reflect your own touch to creativity!!
* **Urgent** on line 4 of index you will see my relative pathway for my project, your relative pathway most likely will differ, so go ahead and change it so the index.html, and style.css can work like teamates, Also on lines 31 - 36 make sure to correctly path this
